first draft
  semi-manual write
  automatic read

chunks??
  feels like files should be kept together; don't want partial file errors
  otoh, streaming could mean chunks are useful, so you don't have to copy the entire file before reading a segment
    but maybe a thing we design to allow, but defer actually doing

record:
  dirs
    dirs
    hashes
  hash
    true file (path to cache) ...or, just let the system find it, probably
    or?
    who has it
      streaming?

registry
  nodes
    //DUMMY start with explicit list, but maybe eventually autodiscovery
    keep file list in sync among all of them
      deconflict changes?
  virtual tree
    dir
      name
      [
        | dir
        | file
      ]
    file
      name
      hash

create
  (storage limits?)
  add file locally
  register with network (trigger distro)

  (storage limits?)
  ????

distro
  ensure:
    for each file f (//THINK by path or hash?  ie, what of unlisted files?) 
      f is present on at least N active nodes
    if not, copy it to remote
      //THINK deconflict with storage limits
